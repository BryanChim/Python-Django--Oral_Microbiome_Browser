Python-Django--Oral_Microbiome_Browser
======================================
This is an extensive bioinformatics project that I completed for my graduate practicum. The final product is an interactive browser-based application that can search for/filter information on the oral microbiome of dental patient samples. 

NOTE: The Python scripts used to parse and reformat the RDP Classifier, Clinical and Taxonomy data are located in the repo **"Python--Bioinformatics" under the directory "PRACTICUM--Oral_Microbiome_Browser"**

If you have Python-Django installed on your system, you can try out this browser with the following steps:

1) Clone this repository to your computer

2) Open your command-line/shell and navigate to said repository on your computer

3) Enter >python manage.py runserver

4) Open your web browser of choice, and navigate to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

5) Enjoy!  

* If you're unable or do not wish to run the application, you can see screenshots of interface in the images **"Django Pages.jpg"** and **"Django Pages2.jpg"**
